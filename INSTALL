Buiding on Linux
----------------

To Build:
- Extract the sources into a directory, e.g. wb6
- Install dependencies. For Ubuntu and other Debian based distros type this in a
  command line terminal:
  $> sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake autoconf automake pkg-config libtool libzip-dev libxml2-dev libsigc++-2.0-dev libglade2-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx mesa-common-dev libmysqlclient-dev libmysqlcppconn-dev uuid-dev liblua5.1-dev libpixman-1-dev libpcre3-dev libgnome2-dev libgnome-keyring-dev libgtk2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev python-dev libboost-dev libctemplate0 libctemplate-dev mysql-client python-pysqlite2 libsqlite3-dev iodbc libiodbc2 libiodbc2-dev libtinyxml-dev
- You will also need to install VSQLite++ from https://github.com/vinzenz/vsqlite--. Check the INSTALL file there for installation instructions.
- Create a build directory (better if you create it outside the Workbench source tree), e.g. wb-build
- Change the directory to the build directory you have just created, e.g. cd ../wb-build
- Run cmake <path to workbench tree> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path where you want WB to be> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
- Run make -j3 install

Note about swig:
- You will need swig 1.3 to build WB

Note about antlr:
- Antlr 3.4 is needed, but the current release has many bugs. You will need it patched with https://github.com/antlr/antlr3/pull/43 if you don't want to use the bundled version.
  Then you'll need to 
      
      export ANTLR_JAR_PATH=<path_to_your_antlr_complete_file>

Building on Windows
-------------------

To build on Windows, you need Visual Studio 2010 with C++ and C# support.
You also need the latest mysql-workbench-externals-1.0-win32 package, which
contains pre-compiled binaries of all the 3rd party libraries that Workbench 
depends on.

To Build:
- Unpack mysql-gui-win-res in the same top directory as Workbench itself
- Go to the mysql-workbench directory
- Open MySQLWorkbench.sln solution file
- Select Release_OSS or the Debug Configuration
- Select x86 as the Platform
- Build Project



Buiding on Mac OS X
-------------------

To Build:
- Go to http://rudix.org/ and download and install the following packages
  gettext, glib, libpng, libsigc++, lua, pkg-config, pcre, libzip, cairo, pixman
- Install MySQL 5.5.x 32bit (64bit will not work), make sure /usr/local/mysql
  points to the correct installation
- Install MySQL Connector/C++, vsqlite++
- Install Xcode 4.1.0 or later and open the MySQLWorkbench.xcodeproj file
- Select the OS X 10.6 and Debug or Release and build
